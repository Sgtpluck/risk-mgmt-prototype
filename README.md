## 10x Open Data Risk Mgmt Tool

A little prototype based on the original Phase 2 Findings.



## Getting Started
Clone down the repo, run an `npm install` to install dependencies, and then use `npm start` to run the webpack server. The server will run at `localhost:8080`.

If you fill out likelihood and impact level of different types of risk and then hit the submit button at the bottom, you will get a scatter graph that maps the likelihood vs impact.

At the moment this prototype:

1. Doesn't look nice.
2. there are no validations about filling in a radio button.
3. Has no weighting attached
4. Is just to look at as an example.
